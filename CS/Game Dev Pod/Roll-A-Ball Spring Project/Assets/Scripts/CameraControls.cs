    // Select the 'MainCamera' GameObject in the Hierarchy window
    // In the Inspector window, exapnd the camera's 'Camera Controls compoent'

    // In the Heirarachy, select the 'Player' GameObject to access its components in the Inspector window
    // Exapnd the 'Transform' component, and manually change the player character's position
